The master's work dedicated to the creation of a quadcopter remote controlling software. The developed software product is a cross-platform application for quadcopter control, and the software developed for used microcontrollers can be easily modified and supplemented with new functions. In the development process, modern technologies were used, such as C #, XAML, Wi-Fi, UWP who proved they are reliable enough to use. The result of this work is the simplified creation of quadrocopter, including the use of cheaper components and the expansion of the quadrocopter functionality.
Key words: Quadcopter, Arduino,ESP, C#, UWP, crossplatform, microcontroller boards, Wi-Fi.
